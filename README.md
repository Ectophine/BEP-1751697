# Bachelor End Project - Meaghan Wijnmaalen 1751697

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor End Project (BEP), completed in academic year 2024-2025. This project was completed in R with the stm package for topic modeling.

## The Dataset

The dataset, which is included in this repository, can originally be found at https://osf.io/jzrvh/?view_only=0195bd62f6974482b02fbc3c2912dbf4. There is an accompanying paper as well, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07217.

## The Code

Two main .R files were used throughout my research. Exploratory data analysis and parameter testing for the topic models was completed in eda.R. The actual topic model estimation, as well as accompanying visualizations and 
statistical tests, were completed in analysis.R. Both of these files can be run independently of each other. 

Much of the coding process, from set-up to visualizations, was inspired by the tutorial recommended by my supervisor, which can be found here https://warin.ca/shiny/stm/#section-the-structural-topic-model. Additionally, the code I used for the n-gram differentiation test
was provided by my supervisor, Riccardo Loconte. I made adjustments to both the tutorial and provided testing code to better fit my project and research questions, but both of these sources were integral in coding the base processes of this project.

## Visualizations

Visualizations that were used in the final paper can be found in the Visualizations folder. Additionally, the code for creating these visualizations can all be found in the analysis.R file.
